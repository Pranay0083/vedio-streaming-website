# üåü Inspiration

The idea for this Learning Management System was born out of a personal connection to my coaching center's mission. My coach aspired to extend their reach and support students beyond their geographical constraints, enabling them to learn and grow regardless of location.  

Additionally, I am deeply passionate about giving back to society and making a positive impact. Through this project, I aim to create a platform that provides accessible, quality education to students everywhere. This LMS is my way of merging technology with education to bridge gaps and foster learning opportunities for all.

# üöÄ Future Updates

To enhance the functionality and usability of this Learning Management System, here are some planned updates for the future:

- **Quiz Section**: Add interactive quizzes after each lecture to help students evaluate their understanding of the topics covered.
- **Comprehensive Weekly Reports**: Generate detailed performance reports for students, summarizing their progress, attendance, and scores.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Develop a dedicated dashboard for administrators to manage users, content, and platform analytics efficiently.
- **Teacher Dashboard**: Create a user-friendly dashboard for teachers to track student progress, upload lectures, and manage quizzes and assignments.

Stay tuned for more features that will make learning and teaching even more seamless and engaging!
